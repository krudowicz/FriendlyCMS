State of the project:
---------------------
Currently the project is abandoned, I don't have enough time to invest it in developing it. 
It will probably will be resumed when I decide that I am able to properly continue it in a timely manner and have the capability to do it properly.

Description:
------------
It was supposed to be quite basic Content Management System made as a practice project with potential of becoming one of my main assets in future work.
Made with use of Yii2 Framework and SemanticUI for Yii2. Basicly it was meant to be a practice run with chosen tools. 
The main functionality was: adding new subpages, adding and editing content(including photos etc.) to existing pages, managing people authorised to work with pages according to their set priviledges, adding and editing users in the projects.

Current capabilities/problems:
---------------------

CAPABILITIES:
- At this moment the CMS should be able to connect to the existing database, provide ability to edit existing pages(without adding/editing photos, editing layout etc.). It has crudely implemented polish-english translation which is probably incomplete right now.

PROBLEMS:
- The UI looks like something broke with CSS styling and buttons are misplaced.
- Translations are not complete and working not as good as they should(not implemented the lang change in the login screen).
- Many UI elements are not complete.
- Security is probably a big issue as I didn't look at it yet at the time I stopped working on the system.

Conclusion:
-----------
It needs much more work until it is at least semi-complete. For now it is just a crude prototype. 
When the time comes it will need a good code review and refactoring as well as just many more workhours to work properly and to look better and clearer "inside".
The main problem with the project was fairly basic knowledge of used framework which resulted in not optimal implementation of existing features, a little chaos in code and probably many problems with the system working properly.

If you have a question, write me. I will try to answer as best as my knowledge allows me to.
